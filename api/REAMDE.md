This script retrieves and displays the TODO list progress of a given employee using a public REST API. It fetches the employee's name, counts the completed and total tasks, and neatly lists all the completed task titles. It's designed for quick CLI usage with minimal dependencies, making it a lightweight and useful tool for practicing REST API consumption in Python.
